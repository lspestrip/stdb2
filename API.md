# REST API

`stdb2` implements a REST API which allows to access programmatically
part of the data in the database via HTTP. Here are its primary features:

- The API only allows to *get* data, i.e., it does not allow to  create/modify/delete entries in the database.
- No need to authenticate.
- All responses are sent as JSON records.
